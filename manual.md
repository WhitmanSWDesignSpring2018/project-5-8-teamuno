**Importing Midi files**

Importing Midi files is easy with this feature. Just select "Import Midi" under the File menu. 
Choose your desired Midi (.mid) file containing Midi tracks and messages, and the application will automatically load the information into the composition.
*Warning: Large files may take a while to load.

The length of the Midi file does not matter; the application will extend the composition pane to accomodate for each Midi note.
Once the import has completed, enjoy your Midi information right in your own TuneComposer!

NOTES: Current functionality only supports single channel Midi files. If Midi files with multiple channels/instruments are uploaded, each channel will be imported as a Piano instrument.
